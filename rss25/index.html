        <h2>What is This Workshop About?</h2>
        <p>
            The past decade has seen significant advancements in multi-robot systems, particularly in decision-making, coordination, control, navigation, and reinforcement learning for multi-agent
            systems. Despite this progress, the real-world deployment of robotic teams remains
            a challenge. This workshop aims to bring together experts from academia, industry, and
            government to explore key research areas and identify the critical barriers preventing
            scalable multi-robot deployment from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Current research in multi-robot systems predominantly assumes cooperative or optimally
            performing agents, often overlooking scenarios where certain agents may act adversarially or
            perform suboptimally due to uncertainty or environmental disturbances. A critical challenge in
            advancing real-world deployment is the development of resilient decision-making algorithms
            that enable robotic teams to adapt to unforeseen situations, operate safely in dynamic
            environments, and achieve mission objectives despite uncertainty and potential adversarial
            influences. Additionally, the absence of datasets and benchmarks that account for adversarial
            factors in real-world multi-robot tasks remains a significant barrier, limiting the ability to
            rigorously evaluate and improve the robustness of autonomous systems in such conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Addressing these challenges requires robust methodologies that integrate decision-making
            under uncertainty, adversarial resilience, and partial information handling, particularly in the
            context of dynamically evolving conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            To advance the field, the workshop will focus on recent theoretical and practical
            advancements, with particular emphasis on areas such as model-based reinforcement
            learning, multi-robot planning, and adaptive control strategies. Through invited talks, panel
            discussions, and interactive sessions, we will foster collaboration across disciplines to develop
            scalable, verifiable, and deployable solutions for real-world multi-robot systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The workshop will feature a lightning talks session and invites high-quality paper submissions
            on decision-making in multi-robot and multi-agent systems. Topics of interest include, but are
            not limited to:
